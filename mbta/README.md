Assignment #2

In this assignment, I have created an interactive map using Google Map's API. I have centerest the map at South Station when initially displayed, and connected the stations by polylines according to the routes. Upon clicking each station's marker, the schedule for the upcoming trains will be displayed. The schedule is fetched by requesting access to MBTA's API, and it is categorized into northbound and southbound directions. I have also used the geolocation function to show user's location on the map as well as caculating the distance to the closest station. When user's marker is clicked, the closest station and its distance from the user will be shown in the infowindow. 

I have finished the assignment individually, and it took me approximately ten hours to finish. The css and html files have passed the W3C validation.
