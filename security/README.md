Assignment #4
Yishu Huang

In this assignment, I have conducted a security assessment for the web application, calm-sea-53952, and written a security report that documents the disocovered vulnerabilities, sample attacks, and the mitigation recomendations. I have analyzed the potential exploitation of three vulnerabilities: NoSQL injection, XSS, and CORF and briefly mentioned the risky setting of Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. I have as well put the report in an HTML file.

I have discussed with Wenlu Zheng, my partner for this assignment, to interpret her source code. It took me around four hours to research and discover the vulnerabilities both manually and using Burp Suite Scanner, three hours to conduct sample attacks, and three hours to finish the report.
