Lab 7

In this lab, I have used both Javascript and jQuery to modify the web content; local storage is enabled by storing user's input into key-value pairs. Previous messages are shown when the website is re-opened.

I have spent 1 hour on this lab andworked on it independently. CSS and HTML files have passed validation.
