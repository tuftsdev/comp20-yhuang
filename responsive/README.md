Lab 4

In this lab, I have used CSS sprites and media queries to display different parts of an image according to the size of the screen that the image is displayed. The correct part of image is displayed when screen size varies. The CSS file has passed the W3C CSS validation. 

I have finished this lab independently. It took me around two hours to finish this assignment.
